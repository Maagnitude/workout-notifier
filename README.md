# Workout Notifier - For those who forget to move a little bit

Feel free to clone this repo. 

## Install the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the python script
```
python workout-notifier.py
```

## Enter the desired YouTube url and time (hour/minute)
```
Enter the url of a workout YouTube video (or press Enter): ___
Enter the hour of the day for the reminder (or press Enter): ___
Enter the minute of the hour for the reminder (or press Enter): ___
```

## or leave the default ones
```
Default workout YouTube video: 4 Minute OFFICE STRETCHING(full body)
Default hour/minute: 15:50
```

...and you're good to go. When the time comes, the YouTube video will pop up, get in fullscreen mode, and play until its end.

When it's finished, the browser tab is automatically closed, and timer is reset for the next days.

Or you can just close the tab yourself, before the video's end, and the timer will reset anyways.
